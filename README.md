# ML-VideoGame-Tiktok
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on classification and regression tasks using video game sales and TikTok datasets. The project includes data exploration, machine learning model implementation, and performance evaluation.

Project Overview
Classification Task: Predicts outcomes using Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) models on a dataset.
Regression Task: Predicts life expectancy using Linear Regression.
Datasets: Includes modified TikTok and video game sales datasets.
Performance Metrics: Classification models achieved high accuracy, with K-NN performing slightly better. The regression model demonstrated near-perfect performance.
